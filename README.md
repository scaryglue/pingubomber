# Penguin Bomber

In reminiscence of the old Pingubomber flash game, I decided to remake the game from the ground up in Unity.

This game doesn't aspire to be the exact same as the old flash version, but I wanted it to be a **lightweight** and **small** game to play with friends.

This game is still early in development, it lacks *many* features, some of them I'm going to list in this Readme. Of course any feature ruests are appreciated, but this is a project I'm working on in my freetime, so I only have a limited time to spend on this project.

## TODOs

* Online Mode

This is probably the biggest one, but I have no experience in online multiplayer games, but I will try to implement it in the future


* Singleplayer Mode

* More items
